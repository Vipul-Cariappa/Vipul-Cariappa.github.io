                <h3>PyC</h3>
                <p>
                  PyC is a general purpose binding between Python Programming
                  Language and C/C++. My goal behind developing this binding is
                  to enable the use of C/C++ libraries inside Python with very
                  few to no modifications to the source libraries and without
                  any recompilations of the original library. Currently PyC only
                  works on linux machines where the library is compiled to a
                  shared object (.so file / dynamic library). PyC is purely
                  written in C. It depends on libclang to parse the header file
                  of the library to identify function symbols available and
                  their parameter types and typedefs, structs, unions and enums.
                  PyC is actively being developed and is not bug free yet. You
                  can find the link to the
                  <a href="https://github.com/Vipul-Cariappa/PyC"
                    >source here.</a

              <div class="container" id="SciVis">
                <h3>SciVis</h3>
                <p>
                  SciVis stands for Scientific Visualizer. Even though it is
                  called Scientific Visualizer it should have actually been
                  MathVis, because all the visualizations available right now
                  are related to mathematics. With this you can visualize or
                  graph any mathematical function. SciVis can also compute and
                  visualize Taylor series and Fourier series of any given
                  function. SciVis can calculate integral and derivative of any
                  given function and graph it. SciVis also provides a truth
                  table generator. There are many more visualizations planned to
                  be implemented and development is still going on. The site is
                  developed using svelte and the backend is developed in
                  fastAPI. You can find the
                  <a href="https://sci-vis.vercel.app/">site here</a>, and the
                  <a href="https://github.com/Vipul-Cariappa/Math-Stuff"

                <h3>py-lua</h3>
                <p>
                  Similar to PyC, py-lua is also a general purpose binding. This
                  time it is between Python Programming Language and Lua
                  Programming Language. Py-lua lets you use any lua module
                  inside of python and also allows the use of any python module
                  inside lua. It converts data types between the two languages
                  seamlessly and also supports Object Oriented Programming
                  features. Py-lua can also propagate exceptions raised in one
                  language to the other language. It is written in C Programming
                  Language. You can find the

                  Inspired from competitive programming sites like leetcode and
                  codewars. I wanted to know how these sites are implemented. So
                  I created my own version of it. Here you can create your own
                  questions also, to which you need to write a solution and also
                  the test cases to verify if the answer is correct. You can
                  find the
                  <a href="https://github.com/Vipul-Cariappa/code"
                    >source here</a
                  >
                  and the
                  <a href="https://code.vipulcariappa.xyz/">site here</a>. The
                  site is hosted only for demo purposes and I do not recommend
                  to actually write your own questions, even though you can try
                  out the 3 questions which are already available.

                <h3>Expenses Recorder</h3>
                <p>
                  This web site will help you manage your daily expenses. This
                  site allows a user to form groups and collectively track
                  expenses. A user can form groups and share its name and
                  password with others to join the group. Members in a group can
                  add, edit and delete bill's created. Creator of a group has
                  the ability to remove an existing member from the group or/and
                  delete the group. You can find the
                  <a
                    href="https://github.com/Vipul-Cariappa/Expenses-Recorder-Web"

                  and the link to the
                  <a href="https://expense.vipulcariappa.xyz/">site here.</a>
                  Again the site is hosted only for demo purposes and I do not
                  guarantee any data integrity and data security.
