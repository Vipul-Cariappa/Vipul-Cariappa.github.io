I am a student at Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences, Bangalore, pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I love to program and write code. Presently my programming interests are programming languages, their design and implementations. My interests keep changing as I am still exploring the vastness of computer science. Computational mathematics is something which has caught my eyes recently. I am very much fond of open source technologies and love to contribute. I am trying to learn, explore and spread my findings to others.

My hobbies and other interests include mathematics, swimming, eating and playing lots of video games.
