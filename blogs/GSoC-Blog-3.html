                    Moved the repository which was previously hosted by a single
                    person to hosting it under the GNU Octave project at GitLab.
                    Work on this front was mainly done by my mentor <a href="https://gitlab.com/cbm755">Colin</a>. Link
                    to the repository at GitLab:

                  <li>
                    Supporting the latest versions of Python in Pythonic.
                    <br />Pythonic previously only supported Python version 3.9
                    and below. Now Pythonic supports the latest version of
                    Python which is Python 3.11. Link to Merged MR at GitLab:

                  <li>
                    Using Python Stable ABI in Pythonic to support multiple
                    versions of Python.
                    <br />Pythonic now uses
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html#stable"
                      >Python Stable ABI</a
                    >. Python Stable ABI is a limited subset of the Python C API
                    which Python Organisation grantees to be backward and
                    forward compatible with old and new versions of Python. Link

                  <li>
                    Updating the CI/CD pipeline at GitLab to test Pythonic
                    against multiple versions of Python and Octave. <br />In
                    this update, we also migrated to use the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/gnuoctave/octave">official Docker
                    image for Octave</a> provided by GNU Octave. Now our automated
                    CI/CD testing, tests Pythonic with the latest version of
                    Octave which is version 8.2 with all the supported Python
                    versions i.e. from Python version 3.7 to 3.11. It also tests
                    Octave 7.1 with Python 3.9 and Octave 6.1 with Python 3.10.

                    point are restricted to testing on Linux. For testing on
                    other platforms read the sections below.

                  <li>
                    Provide proof of concept of <code>pyimport</code>.
                    <br /><code>pyimport</code>
                    is a command to import Python functions, classes,
                    namespaces, or any other symbols into the Octave workspace.
                    The concept is appreciated, but may not be merged into the
                    main branch as it is a workaround to the fact that function
                    handles are not yet supported on Pythonic. Link to Merge

                  <li>
                    Implementation of destructor for <code>pyobject</code>s.
                    <br />Destructor was previously not supported on Pythonic.
                    Variables which were no longer used were still kept in
                    memory and were not freed/released from memory. This was due
                    to a bug in the core Octave interpreter (<a
                      href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?46497"
                      >bug #46497, classdef: delete destructor method…</a
                    >). This bug is now fixed. Link to Merge Request at GitLab:

                    Implementation of <code>pyenv</code> function. <br /><code
                      >pyenv</code
                    >
                    is a MATLAB compatibility function. <code>pyenv</code> lets
                    the user select the version of Python to be used. At the
                    time of writing this article, the
                    <code>pyenv</code> functionality is working properly on
                    Linux systems, but using it on Windows crashes Octave. To
                    me, it looks like an issue with how Octave is packaged on
                    Windows. Because depending on how Octave is launched the
                    functionality works or does not work. Any progress on this
                    will be appended to this article later. Link to Merge

                    Testing on Windows (and MacOS) <br />I am primarily focusing
                    on Windows. My mentor is currently looking at MacOS. Octave
                    does not offer a Windows Docker image to test on Windows.
                    Compiling any octave package which contains C/C++ code
                    required some Linux specific tools to be installed (at least
                    in the case of Pythonic), which is usually bundled with
                    Octave on Windows. But compiling Pythonic on GitLab's CI/CD
                    pipeline has been a work with no success till now. Link to
